------------------------------ Getting Started

This code package implements a simple model of parton energy loss in QGP during relativistic heavy ion collisions, which together with Glauber Monte Carlo estimates of event shape plots points in the energy loss - event area plane. The package interfaces with a local build of TGlauberMC, the Glauber Monte Carlo written by C. Loizides Et. Al. See:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07098

The package requires no building or instillation, and should run immediately upon download. However, some features have not yet been fully implemented, or require user interfacing. To begin, data for PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV recorded in ALICE are included as an instructional case. To generate plots, first cd to /src/ relative to this directory. When there, energy loss estimates can be generated from the reference data by running:

root -l -q energyloss_pTspectra.c

In the same directory, Glauber event shape estimates for a given centrality class can be generated by running relevant code:

bash -f runall_local.sh

This will run the code for Monte Carlo event generation (handled by runGlauber_local.c), followed by the compilation of generated events (handled by compile_glauber.c). The centrality class is chosen by modifying the appropriate variables in config.h. This centrality class must match a centrality class from the spectrum data to be matched with energy loss data.

To plot the resulting point in the event area - energy loss plane, run 

root -l -q energyloss_eventshape.c

This will plot all available energy loss - event area pairs with matching centrality class. To plot more points, change the centrality class and re-run

bash -f runall_local.sh

to generate MC events in this bin. Repeat for all available centrality classes included in data to plot all points. For the included reference PbPb spectra, there are 15 available centrality bins, stored in the following array:

const int centrality_list[15][2] = {
  { 0,  5}, { 5, 10}, {10, 20}, {20, 30}, {30, 40},
  {40, 50}, {50, 60}, {60, 70}, {70, 80}, { 0, 10},
  { 0, 20}, {20, 40}, {40, 60}, {40, 80}, {60, 80}
};

This array must be set manually for each new spectrum data, since centrality binning conventions vary between experiments and sqrt_s. An image of the resulting reference plot that should be obtained by running

root -l -q energyloss_eventshape.c

for the 9 smallest non-overlapping bins (0-5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%) available centrality classes is also included in /plots/PbPb_2.76TeV/energyloss_eventshape.pdf.


------------------------------ Adding more energy loss data

To include additional data from other experiments/at other energies, the data must first be obtained, i.e. from www.hepdata.net. The PbPb spectra was obtained from

https://www.hepdata.net/record/ins1127497

Download the data with the "ROOT" option. Then, move the resulting unzipped root file to the /tmp/ directory, where there is a macro to unpack this data. After unpacking, the data must be moved to /data.nosync/[SPECIES]_[ENERGY]TeV/spectra/ where it can be accessed by other code in the package. The directories

/plots/[SPECIES]_[ENERGY]TeV/[EXPERIMENT]/fitting/
/plots/[SPECIES]_[ENERGY]TeV/glauber/centbin_[LOWCENT]-[HIGHCENT]/

must also be created to store output energyloss and glauber plots respectively. The output eventshape_energyloss plot will be stored in

/plots/[SPECIES]_[ENERGY]TeV/eventshape_energyloss.pdf

Data for energy loss and event shape are likewise stored in

/data.nosync/[SPECIES]_[ENERGY]TeV/eventshape_energyloss.root

------------------------------ Glauber Modeling for non-standard nuclei

Some nuclei beyond the standard few (p, d, Pb, Au, Xe, Cu) are included in the Glauber, but require the creation of a local centrality reference. The code to implement this is functional, but not yet fully integrated with the package. Contact me (address below) about this if relevant to your work.

------------------------------

Please email ryan.hamilton@yale.edu if any questions about the package arise! Some quality-of-life improvements will be implemented in future versions of the package to make much of this (directory creation, centrality bin handling) automatic.
